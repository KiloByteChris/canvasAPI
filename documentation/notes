3/12/18 notes
- !!!! Why does the courses thing return old courses? !!!!
- Modules only goes to the module, how to I display info for indavidule modules? I already set up an api but then went to assignments.
- Get rid of the grades button and just display the current grade with the heading
- Try to finish development today and switch to style on wednesday
- Make the paghe auto update when the select box is selected? Instead of using the button?
- change the date display for the assignments
- Create a homepage with an recent updates. Is there an updates api? announcments api. Use that
