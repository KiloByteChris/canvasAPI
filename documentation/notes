3/12/18 notes
-Why does the courses thing return old courses? 
-Modules only goes to the module, how to I display info for indavidule modules? I already set up an api but then went to assignments.
-Get rid of the grades button and just display the current grade with the heading
- Try to finish development today and switch to style on wednesday
- Make the paghe auto update when the select box is selected? Instead of using the button?
